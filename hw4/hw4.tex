\begin{problem}[3.2.1]
  Assuming as known the cup product structure on the torus $S^1\times S^1$,
  compute the cup product structure in $H^*(M_g)$ for $M_g$ the closed
  orientable surface of genus $g$ by using the quotient map from $M_g$
  to a wedge sum of $g$ tori.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[3.2.2]
  Using the cup product
  $H^k(X,A;R)\times H^\ell(X,B;R)\rightarrow H^{k+\ell}(X,A\cup B;R)$, show that
  if $X$ is the union of contractible open subsets $A$ and $B$, then all cup
  products of positive-dimensional classes in $H^*(X;R)$ are zero. This applies
  in particular if $X$ is a suspension. Generalize to the situation that $X$ is
  a union of $n$ contractible open subsets, to show that the $n$-fold cup
  products of positive dimensional classes are zero.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  First note that since $A$ is contractible we get an isomorphism
  \[
    \xymatrix{
      0 \ar[r] & H^k(X,A;R) \ar[r] & H^n(X;R) \ar[r] & 0
    }
  \]
  Similarly we also get an isomorphism with $H^k(X,B;R)$ and $H^k(X;R)$.

  Using this with the naturality of the cup product we get a commutative
  diagram
  \[
    \xymatrix{
      H^k(X,A;R)\times H^\ell(X,B;R) \ar[r]^-\smile \ar[d]^{\cong }& H^{k+\ell}(X,A\cup B;R)\cong 0 \ar[d]\\
      H^k(X;R)\times H^\ell(X;R) \ar[r]^-\smile & H^{k+l}(X;R)
    }
  \]
  However since this map factors through zero it must be the case that
  the cup product is zero for positive dimensions.

  In the case where $X=\bigcup_i A_i$ we still have the same isomorphisms as before.
  As such our new diagram is
  \[
    \xymatrix{
      \prod_i H^{k_i}(X,A;R) \ar[r]^-{\smile} \ar[d]^{\cong}& H^{\Sigma_ik_i}(X,\bigcup A_i;R)\cong 0 \ar[d]\\
      \prod_i H^{k_i}(X;R) \ar[r] & H^{\Sigma_i k_i}(X;R)
    }
  \]
  which gives us zero on the cup product for positive dimensions via the same
  reasoning as above.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}[3.2.4]
  Apply the Lefschetz fixed point theorem to show that every map
  $f:\bb{C}P^n\rightarrow\bb{C}P^n$ has a fixed point if $n$ is even, using
  the fact that $f^*:H^*(\bb{C}P^n;\bb{Z})\rightarrow H^*(\bb{C}P^n;\bb{Z})$
  is a ring homomorphism. When $n$ is odd show there is a fixed point unless
  $f^*(\alpha)=-\alpha$, for $\alpha$ a generator of $H^2(\bb{C}P^n;\bb{Z})$.
  [See Exercise 3 in \S 2.C for an example of a map without fixed points in
  this exceptional case.]
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Recall that $H^*(\bb{C}P^n;\bb{Z})\cong\bb{Z}(\alpha)/(\alpha^{n+1})$ and that
  $H^k(\bb{C}P^n;\bb{Z})$ is $\bb{Z}$ for even dimensions and zero otherwise. For
  $f^*:H^2(\bb{C}P^n;\bb{Z})\rightarrow H^2(\bb{C}P^n;\bb{Z})$ this is an endomorphism on the integers.
  As such it must be of the form $f^*(\alpha)=c\alpha$ for some $c\in\bb{Z}$. Moreover since
  $f^*$ is also an endomorphism on the cohomology ring it must be that
  $f^*(\alpha^m)=c^m\alpha^m$. Since the $\Ext$ term in the universal coefficient theorem
  will be zero for $\bb{C}P^n$ we have that $f^*$ is the hom dual of $f_*$.
  Since multiplication maps are unaffected by hom dual the Lefschetz number of
  $f$ is
  \[
    \tau(f)= 1+c+\cdots+c^n
  \]

  The only possible rational roots of $\tau(f)$ are $\pm 1$. Since all the coefficients
  are positive $1$ is not a root. If $n$ is even $-1$ cannot be as well. If
  $n$ is odd and $f^*(\alpha)\neq-\alpha$ ($c\neq -1$), then $\tau(f)$ has no roots as well.

  Therefore by the Lefschetz fixed point theorem the map $f$ has a fixed point if
  $n$ is even or if $f(\alpha)\neq -\alpha$.
\end{proof}
