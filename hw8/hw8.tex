\begin{problem}[3.3.8]
  For a map $f:M\rightarrow N$ between connected closed orientable
  $n$-manifolds, suppose there is a ball $B\subset N$ such that $f^{-1}(B)$ is
  the disjoint union of balls $B_i$ each mapped homeomorphically by $f$ onto
  $B$. Show the degree of $f$ is $\sum_i\epsilon_i$ where $\epsilon_i$ is
  $+1$ or $-1$ according to whether $f:B_i\rightarrow B$ preserves or reverses
  local orientations induced from given fundamental classes $[M]$ and $[N]$.

\begin{problem}[3.3.9]
  Show that a $p$-sheeted covering space projection $M\rightarrow N$ has
  degree $\pm p$, when $M$ and $N$ are connected closed orientable manifolds.

\begin{problem}[3.3.10]
  Show that for a degree $1$ map $f:M\rightarrow N$ of connected closed
  orientable manifolds, the induced map $f_*:\pi_1 M\rightarrow \pi_1 N$ is
  surjective, hence also $f_*:H_1(M)\rightarrow H_1(N)$. [Lift $f$ to the
  covering space $\wt{N}\rightarrow N$ corresponding to the subgroup
  $\img f_*\subset\pi_1 N$, then consider the two cases that this covering is
  finite sheeted or infinite sheeted.]
